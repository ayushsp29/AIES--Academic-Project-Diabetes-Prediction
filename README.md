### 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the risk of diabetes based on clinical and lifestyle data. The models are trained and evaluated on patient datasets to identify potential risk factors and accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

### 🚀 Features

* Utilizes multiple ML algorithms:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Comparative performance analysis of each model
* Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Clean and interpretable visualizations for result analysis
* Focus on reducing false positives and improving early diagnosis
* Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility and ease of experimentation

### 📊 Dataset

The project uses a publicly available diabetes dataset (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset from Kaggle or UCI) consisting of attributes like:

* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* Blood Pressure
* Skin Thickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age

### 🎯 Goal

To build a robust, interpretable, and accurate ML-based classification model that aids in early diabetes risk detection and enables proactive healthcare interventions.
